            <h2 class="abstrak2">Abstract</h2>
            <li class="abstrak">The Integrated Learning (IL) program has provided an opportunity for grade IX students
                to experience direct entrepreneurship by organizing a bazaar. In this program, 6 students are grouped,
                giving them the opportunity to use their creative minds to make their personalized store, and handmade
                products that <strong>were sold</strong> to customers during the bazaar. Our group focused on developing products through
                various creative processes, including biotechnology, sewing, and crafting. This project required us to
                not only create quality products, but also to consider the financial and marketing aspect and view of
                running a business. By participating in this program, valuable insights <strong>were gained</strong> into how businesses
                operate, from the execution of making the products to selling them real-time.</li>
            <li class="abstrak">At the start of the project, brainstorming discussions <strong>were held</strong> to create innovative
                ideas from each group member, sometimes online and another period of time offline. During this time,
                different product options <strong>were discussed</strong>, and examinations or trials of making that product <strong>were
                conducted</strong> to decide which items would be ideal to produce. Once the final products <strong>had been decided</strong>
                upon, materials <strong>had been bought</strong> and gathered, it was time to engage our production plan. Each member <strong>had
                been assigned</strong> specific tasks based on their strengths, making sure that every aspect of the business was
                handled effectively. Additionally, marketing strategies <strong>were developed</strong>, and promotional materials <strong>were
                designed</strong> to attract customers during the bazaar.</li>
            <li class="abstrak">Throughout the production process, there were a few adjustments that <strong>had to be made</strong> as
                a few challenges <strong>were encountered</strong> during the process. One of the biggest difficulties was managing time,
                as the production process took longer than expected. Some materials were unavailable/out of stock in
                online shops, requiring us to find substitutes while maintaining product quality. Pricing decisions <strong>were
                    also difficult</strong>, as we had to balance affordability with making a profit. Through teamwork and effective
                communication, these obstacles <strong>were overcome</strong>, and the bazaar <strong>was successfully executed</strong>, providing us
                with real life experience in entrepreneurship.</li>
            <li class="abstrak">Through this project, many lessons <strong>were learned</strong> about business management, creativity,
                and collaboration. It became much more clear that running a business is hard, and requires not only
                skill but also adaptability and problem-solving abilities. Mistakes <strong>were made</strong>, but they were remembered
                as opportunities for growing our capabilities. Teamwork and bond <strong>was strengthened</strong>, responsibilities <strong>were
                shared</strong>. This also teaches us the importance of relying on one another. Finally, we learned to appreciate
                the hard work of entrepreneurship and the importance of good and structured planning. This IL program
                was a priceless experience, allowing us grade IXâ€™s to grow both individually and as a team while
                applying academic knowledge to face life situations.</li>
